<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LDPE Resins for Extrusion Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tubular Process</li><li>Autoclave Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>LDPE (Low-Density Polyethylene) resins for extrusion coating are primarily produced using two processes: the tubular and autoclave methods. The tubular process involves the extrusion of polymer through a tubular die, allowing for high production speeds and efficient handling. Conversely, the autoclave process utilizes high-pressure vessels for polymerization, resulting in a more controlled environment that can yield specific properties in the resin. Both methods cater to various applications, including packaging, laminates, and coatings due to their versatility and performance characteristics.</p></p>
